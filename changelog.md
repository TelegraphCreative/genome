* [02/26/2014]

[x] Home Hero - mobile (is pushed down below image content)
Modal Overlay BGs - transition issue in chrome
[x] AddThis - why it's not linking out




* [02/23/2014]

[x] Fixed 'bumping' on css3 animations

[x] Refined how Hero images are handled

[x] Social Icons
    These wack out too quickly under pressure.

[x] Made Browse Menu full bleed




* [02/21/2014]

[x] Should we consider adding an arrow to larger header area to prompt users to scroll? This is an older audience and just realized my oversight (only example that comes to mind: https://medium.com/p/8d43bcb650c5)
    Like it. Click it drop into the readable area.

[x] Add glasses symbol to Subscribe button (see purple top row of buttons for example: https://medium.com/p/8d43bcb650c5)

- Should link color shifts be dark blue, not gray?
    Like it. What shade?

[x] For 1-Across thumbnail, should entire text area link/be clickable? This will help on Mobile, too.
    Markup mistake: header is now clickable. Wou

**Feature**
[x] Should tagline be italicized serif to be consistent with columns & blogs?

[x] Body copy area width be greater (90%)

- Watch video button needs hover
    What sort of hover? Currently hover is an opacity shift in background color. Also, for hero area featureing a vid, the button has a special hover state like 'Explore this Issue'-switches to a video camera. Like?

[x] Slideshow captions don't look right
    Agree. Check them now.

[x] Watch video (aside) icon should be different

[x] fig caption should be sans serif (see comps)

**Blog**
[x] Rule beneath blockquote should match UI

**Column**
[x] Add Read Time icon & meta

[x] Related reading needs more top margin, less bottom margin

**Blog Roll**
[x] Should all meta (including author) be sans in this view since text is so tiny?
    Agree. Will be consistent with article meta
[x] Pagination styles?
[x] line-height of last line/"continue reading" is awkward?

**Story Roll**
[x] Genome icon, not clock, is next to Read Time. Can we swap?

**Universal**
[x] Does sidebar font size match UI? Seems larger?
    Corrected. Resampled font sizes from comp.

[] Will nav transition to thinner bar w/ social sharing icons on Featured Articles?
    Yes.

[x] Lets make BROWSE drop down same width as white area
    Yes.

- Should margin between main content & sidebar be increased?
    I feel like it's sufficient, but am open to suggestions.

[x] All buttons (except Explore) should be all caps, bold, sans. See comps.
    exception: feature
[x] Hover for all light blue buttons (except Explore) should be #7dc98d

**Footer**
- Can I tweak this? In hindsight, I see it's a bulky literal translation of the wireframe. No bueno.
    Of course! Feel free.
[x]  Footer copy hover color be #7dc98d

[x] We need to add a "Blog Stories" aside section on the Homepage. Please see Phase 1 v1 UI design files for reference. This should be placed ABOVE "Most Popular".

[x] "Latest Columns" section should be trimmed back to 3 entries.

[] For "full bleed" images on Home and Featured, can we apply the effects we discussed (https://medium.com/)? If you have changed your mind on how we should handle these sections, let me know!

[x] Perhaps for Subscribe drawer we style the button differently? See the green "Continue" button for example here: http://tympanus.net/Development/CreativeButtons/

[x] Did you catch the "Read More" hover for the homepage cover image? Let's talk if you have any questions.
