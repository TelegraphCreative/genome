          <p class="sans-end">*TruGenome Clinical Sequencing Services is performed in the Illumina CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment)-certified and CAP (College of American Pathologists)-accredited Clinical Services Laboratory. The TruGenome Sequence information is generated by licensed personnel using an analytically validated process. Consistent with Laboratory Developed Tests, it has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This genome sequence information can be analyzed to potentially aid physicians in the evaluation of a broad range of health conditions or physiological traits. Patients will not receive medical results, or a diagnosis, or a recommendation for treatment from Illumina. Any results arising from the analysis of genome sequence information that might be deemed medically actionable should be confirmed using alternative testing. If any questions or concerns arise about what is learned through the genome sequence information, patients should contact their physician or a genetic counselor. Currently Illumina does not accept orders for TruGenome Clinical Sequencing Services from New York.</p>
